					Tetra Concepts is the premier provider of Accumulo professional training sessions. Our training courses are
					designed to empower students with the knowledge necessary to develop cloud applications for production
					environments. The courses are instructed by expert engineers who are also Apache Accumulo source code
					contributors. Our training was developed by Aaron Cordova who led development through the initial 1.0
					release and has worked with government, academic, and commercial organizations to build successful data
					storage, processing, and analysis platforms that build on Accumulo's capabilities. Aaron also developed the
					official government training course for Accumulo and has provided training for many large and small
					organizations over the past four years.
